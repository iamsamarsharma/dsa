Problem: Reverse an Array T[]
Complexity: O(N)

In place mean without any extra memory, we have to use same array which we have used to creat our array

sol:

Step 1: swap first and last element in array
Step 2: increase first index by one and decrease last element by one
Step 3: repeat step one until firstIndex is <= lastIndex
